                    <h2>Shoe House</h2>
                    One of my favorite assignments to do in college, using photoshop is always fun to me and this
                    assignemnt was memorable for me and always look back on this piece to see how much I've truely
                    improved.

                    <h2>Album Cover</h2>
                    This assignment was very much my best looking and by far one of my favorites as well, this was a
                    time consuming assignment but it was worth it in my eyes.
